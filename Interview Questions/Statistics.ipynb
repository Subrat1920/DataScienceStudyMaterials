    "A 'population' is a set of all the element with common characteristics that are subjected to analysis, while 'sample' is the subset of the population which mimics or represents the whole population.\n",
    "A population is the entire group of individuals or items that you want draw the conclusion about, whereas ta sample is a subset of population that is used to make inference about the population"

    "##### 2. Explain the central limit theorem (CLT). Why is it important?\n",
    "The Central Limit Theorem states that the mean of the sample population grows/ approaches to normal distribution as the size of the sample population increases regardless the size of the population. This allows us to extract the inferences from the sample aboout the real population."

    "###### Variance: \n",
    "The variance helps us to determine how well separated and well distributed is the data. We can say that the varaince is the average sqaured deviation from the mean and the data point.\n",
    "###### Standard Deviation:\n",
    "Standard Deviation is the square root of Variance, giving a measure of spread in the same unit as the data."

    "###### Mean:\n",
    "Mean states the average of the dataset. It is used in symmetrical data without outliers.\n",
    "###### Median:\n",
    "Median is something that is presents exactly at middle of a sorted data. It is used when data has outliers.\n",
    "###### Mode:\n",
    "Mode gives us the most frequently repeated value over the whole dataset. It is used to replace the null values, when data is categorical or multimodal."
